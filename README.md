# Kohana UI #

Kohana UI is a valiant attempt to make building dynamic user interfaces a
little bit easier.

## Twitter Bootstrap? ##

The default set of views assume that you will be using the (fantastic) [Twitter
Bootstrap][] CSS framework, but you don't have to. You can write your own views
and stylesheets.

# Versions #

Kohana UI is currently being developed against:

* [Kohana][] 3.2
* [Twitter Bootstrap][] 2.0

This project aims to closely follow the same general spirit of the Kohana
framework itself as regards code organization, in-code documentation, and code
formatting. To this end, suggestions are welcome.
