# Kohana UI Library

A valiant attempt to make building user interfaces a little easier.

This project is currently being developed against:

* [Kohana][] 3.0.7 (current stable tag)

This project aims to closely follow the same general spirit of the Kohana
framework itself as regards code organization, in-line documentation, and code
formatting. To this end, suggestions are welcome.
